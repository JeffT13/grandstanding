So, among other things I've written down, we have, one, Mt. Healthy, plaintiff, he engaged in protected expression. That won't be too hard to show. The defendant harbored retaliatory animus. In a lot of these cases, he did, for political or racial maybe or other reasons. Three, animus was a substantial factor motivating the decision.

That's one way of doing it. That's Justice Rehnquist's way. A second way is that you have to know that -- you at least have to know the arresting policeman, but there is a statute that forbids what he did, you can't find it out later, or no reasonable person would have arrested or no reasonable policeman without the animus would have arrested this person for this thing in the moment.
